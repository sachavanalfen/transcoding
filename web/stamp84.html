      Flag of Iran: <br/>
      The flag of Iran (Persian: پرچم ایران‎, romanized: parčam-e Irân, pronounced [pʰæɾˌtʃʰæme ʔiːˈɾɒːn]), also known as the Three-Coloured Flag (پرچم سه رنگ ایران, parčam-e se rang Irân [pʰæɾˌtʃʰæme se ræŋ ʔiːˈɾɒːn]), is a tricolour comprising equal horizontal bands of green, white and red with the national emblem ("Allah") in red centred on the white band and the takbir written 11 times in the Kufic script in white, at the bottom of the green and the top of the red band.
This flag was adopted on 29 July 1980, as a reflection of the changes brought about by the Iranian Revolution of 1979, which resulted in the replacement of 2,500 years of continuous Persian monarchy with an Islamic Republic under the Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution, supported by a wide range of Islamist organizations[3] and student movements. In opposition to the current regime in Iran, a number of Iranian exiles (particularly in Los Angeles) continue to use the Iranian tricolor with the Lion and Sun at the center.
