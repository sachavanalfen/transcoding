  IRAN-IRAQ ACCORD REPORTED ON OIL SPILL<br/>
  United Nations officials said today that the Iranian and Iraqi Governments had agreed in principle to cooperate in cleaning up an oil spill from Iranian offshore wells covering an area of 7,500 square miles of the Persian Gulf.
<br/>
<br/>
  The tentative agreement, worked out by officials here at the request of Persian Gulf countries, reportedly does not call for a formal cease-fire in the Iranian-Iraqi War to allow the wells to be capped or the cleanup to be done.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a United Nations official who asked not to be identified said the accord did require ''a cessation of hostilities'' in the area of the spill lasting for the duration of the cleanup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The oil is spilling out of damaged offshore platforms belonging to Iran in the war zone between the two countries. The slick was said to be growing at the rate of 10,000 barrrels of oil a day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diego Cordovez, who is Under Secretary General for Special Political Affairs, left for Kuwait today to join in a meeting of Persian Gulf ministers trying to design a plan to counter the growing environmental hazard posed by the spill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United Nations officials said they were cautiously hopeful and the ''positive answers'' given by the two Governments might be the first step toward an overall cease-fire in the war, which began in September 1980.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Iranian delegate here, Said Rajaie-Khorassani, said in an interview that ''this is not the first step in a cease-fire.'' He said there was no need for one and added that the two countries had agreed only ''to set up the political and technical methods to begin the clean-up.''
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources familiar with the negotiations said that although Iraq was interested in a wider-ranging cease-fire and was encouraged by the Iranian communication with the United Nations, the Iraqis feared that any speculation or public comment might jeopardize the outcome of the discussions. Reports from Baghdad have said Iraq cannot accept a cease-fire unless it is assured that Iran will not use such a truce to its military advantage. Iran today rejected a cease-fire on such terms.
  Oil escaping from damaged Iranian offshore rigs near the north end of the Persian Gulf has reportedly spread the full length of the gulf. Although the discharge rate does not appear as large as that of Mexico's Ixtoc 1 in 1979, whose oil contaminated much of the Gulf of Mexico, its consequences may be greater because the Persian Gulf is too small to permit rapid dispersal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At its peak, oil from Ixtoc 1 poured out at the rate of 30,000 barrels a day, or three times that of the Persian Gulf spill. Information on the progress of the Persian Gulf spill remains fragmentary pending analysis of satellite images of the area. Hence, according to environmental specialists in Saudi Arabia, it is difficult at this stage to predict its effects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They depend on uncertain winds and uncertain politics. One or more of the Iranian oil rigs northwest of Kharg Island was apparently damaged by Iraqi military action last month, and there were earlier rumors of some leakage after an accident unrelated to the Iranian-Iraqi war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of last night, according to reports from the area, winds had kept the oil away from the western shores of the gulf, pushing it against the Iranian coast to the east. Winds from the north and east, however, are common there, and they would blow the oil against some of the world's most important oil-exporting ports in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources in Saudi Arabia said yesterday that booms and other devices were being rigged to protect the water intakes of desalting plants in case wind brings the oil ashore. They reported the arrival of a team of American oil spill specialists, including Capt. Harles Corbett of the Coast Guard and Kenneth Biglane of the Environmental Protection Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The effects of the Persian Gulf spill are difficult to predict, in part because studies of the Gulf of Mexico spill were cut short for lack of funds. Both gulfs are rich sources of shrimp, and the spawning season is now at its peak in the Persian Gulf. Shrimp spawn within six miles of the western shoreline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi Arabia has also been developing a Government-supported fishery. It is not yet a large-scale enterprise, but the catch includes sea bass, king mackerel and red snapper. Landfills along the coast reportedly have eliminated wetlands that play an important role in the life cycle of some species, and the shrimp harvest is also said to have declined without the added burden of an oil spill. Effects on Texas Coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to those who worked on the Gulf of Mexico spill, some of it crossed the gulf and blackened beaches along the Padre Island sector of the Texas coast. Fortunately, they said, a combination of favorable winds and countermeasures kept the oil from saturating extensive wetlands, where the ecological damage would have been far more severe than that stemming from beach contamination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spawning of shrimp in the Gulf of Mexico did not appear severely affected by the Mexican spill, although fishermen had to avoid areas blanketed with the tarry mats that formed as the oil weathered and its lighter constituents evaporated. Reports from the Persian Gulf indicate that similar mats are forming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They are not likely to affect shipping, according to those who worked on the Mexican spill, such as Dr. John Robinson of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Dr. Roy W. Hann Jr. of Texas A & M University. In the confined waters of the Persian Gulf, Dr. Robinson said, a spill as extensive at that from Ixtoc 1 would be a major disaster.
