      Howeyzeh was an epic battle, the battle of humans versus tanks, and it began in early morning on 5 January 1981 with 'Nasr operation'. 
This was the biggest tank battle after the second world war. 
Early morning after prayers, young Islamic combatants of Iran got ready and advanced 22 km into enemy's territory.
About 1000 Iraqi prisoners of war (POWs) were captured by Iranian forces. These were Iraqi forces which bombarded Iranian towns and cities virtually every day.
Morning of the second day of operation, 6 January 1981, the courageous Iranian fighters in Howeyzeh in an unequal battle, went into enemy lines virtually with empty hands, and were fired upon by Ba'athist forces -- an act of great courage.
Iraqi tanks attacked Iranian forces from the south, moving north. Iranian forces were under heavy fire. 
The Iranian forces resisted the armed-to-the-teeth enemy, and even managed to push the enemy back.
Iranians were armed with courage, selflessness, and sacrifice.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, commenting on the battle of Howeyzeh said: "The dear Martyr Hussein Alam-ol-Hoda, and other young combatants who accompanied him, they accepted martyrdom, absolutely, and gave everything that they had."
The Iraqi tanks deliberately ran over martyred and injured Iranian combatants.
Today from every corner of the Islamic Republic, Iranian people visit the Howeyzeh cemetery, which symbolizes selfless sacrifice of the martyrs of the revolution and eight-year-imposed war.
