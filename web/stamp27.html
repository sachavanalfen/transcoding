      Iranians each year celebrate the birth anniversary of the divine lady as the national Women’s Day to honor the holy prophet’s daughter, which was blessed with unprecedented divine virtues
The national Women’s Day and Mother’s Day is celebrated on the 20th day of the lunar Islamic month of Jamadi al-Thani, which marks the birthday anniversary of Hazrat Fatemeh Zahra.
Hazrat Fatima was the wife of Imam Ali (PBUH), the first Imam of Shia Muslims, and is referred to as a role model for all women, truth-seekers and entire mankind who want to pave the divine path.
A large number of believers take the occasion of this holiday to honor their mothers, grandmothers, wives and sisters and pay tribute to them by giving them gifts.
It is notable that Imam Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic attached significance to the birth anniversary of the daughter of Islam by announcing the day as women Day.
