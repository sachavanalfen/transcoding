  Red:<br/>
  The red color has many interpretations. On the one hand, it represents the blood of martyrs who staked their lives for the betterment and prosperity of their country. On the other hand, it also stands for resistance and dynamism. It could also stand for the saga of Karbala, a symbol of resistance and martyrdom. Some also believe because the Persian Constitutional Revolution was won in the month of August, the color red represents the heat and also martyrs of that period.
